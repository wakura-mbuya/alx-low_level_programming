## Learning Objecives
In this project, we explore C pointers, arrays and strings. This project covers the following concepts:
- What are pointers and how tho use them
- What are arrays and how to use them
- What are the differences between pointers and arrays
- How to use strings and how to manipulate them
- Scope of variables
