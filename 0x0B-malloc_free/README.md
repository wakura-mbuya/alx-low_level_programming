# 0x0B. C - malloc, free
This project focuses on dynamic memory allocation using malloc. In this project, we learn the differences between automatic and dynamic memory allocation. We also learn what is **malloc** and **free** and how to use them. Also, we learn how to use **valgrind** to check for membory leak.

## Tasks

- **Task 0:** Write a function that creates an array of chars, and initializes it with a specific char.
- **Task 1:** Write a function that returns a pointer to a newly allocated space in memory, which contains a copy of the string given as a parameter.
